#Handling Infromation Overload 

In the web/graphic design industry infromation overload is a constant struggle whether you are a student at a university or self taught. With the industry constantly changing . in order to keep up with the new trends, programs, code, one constantly needs to be studying.  Avoiding information overload is a great way to relieve stress and frustration and can be done if you study efficiently.  

### Surviving information overload 

The key to surviving  information overload is to investing just the rite amount of time  giving you the results needed without any distractions. Results also show that sleeping on information and then refreshing yourself in the morning is a proven informative result that works .  Another task which helps relive overload is to drop some of the new stuff refreshing your self on some of the things you are more knowledgeable on already picking up something new as you do it. 

### Quality over quantity

Its not the amount of knowledge you take in in this career it’s the amount that’s going to be resourceful and needed when pumping out work that is going to be necessary. Remember to always use knowledgeable resources when studying web/graphic design. Making an investment in yourself to obtain studying material and tutorials is also a great idea. In my opinion if you don’t invest in your self then who will want to.
