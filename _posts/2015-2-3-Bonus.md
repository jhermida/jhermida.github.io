#Who Doesn't Like FREE!#

![](http://curtiszimmerman.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/free.gif)

When working with customer based web sites direct marketing usually draws a big crowd of consumers. I believe the best way of direct marketing would be for the company that the website is being created for to offer something for free such as a sample of their product, consultation, or even some coupons or discounts for future purchases, you know something that wont be to big of an expense for the company either. This will give the company a chance to attract the consumer because who doesnâ€™t love something that is free. 
Along with these free things being given by the company it gives them a great advantage to trap the customer into their emailing list. Constantly sending blast emails to the public will constantly remind them of their products or services making you their best bet when needing the companies product or service.
