#Working Smarter Not Harder#

##Planining Ahead##
Planning ahead is the first key step to working smarter not harder. Whether you decide to call it a blue print, storyboard, rough sketch etc. By planning ahead you prevent having to re-do your work over and over again. If your in a field like web copywriting, graphic design, web design/ developing you should always consider some sort of plan to target the objective of the project or product as well as the target audience and background on the product or service which you are working on to give you a better understanding. 

##Objective##
When working with a customer as a designer you always want to make clear what the objective of the website is.  Is the objective of the site to inform the guest, make a sale, display something? You don’t want to go with what you believe is correct and after hard long hours of work you find out that the customer didn’t want to sell it online they just wanted to advertise.

##Audience##
Make sure the layout and text and content you as the designer are implementing attracts the correct audience. (Your selling men’s suites but the text is in graffiti style text because you assumed other wise.)

##Know Your Product/Service##
Make sure you as the designer takes initiative in educating yourself on the product or service just like you wouldn’t have the same content on a car repair shop as you would on a lawyers page , you wouldn’t have the same color scheme if the product you are pitching is for a little girl rather than a senior crowd.
