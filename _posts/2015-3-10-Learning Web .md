Learning web design is a tedious task. Basic web is made up of hypertext markup language embedded resulting in the display of a page. Although take it to consideration the misplacement of one character could be the reason behind you page displaying or not.  Commonly one will need basic knowledge in HTML & CSS both to create your common navigational website. In order to create websites with more extensive coding such as an ecommerce site you will have to learn languages such as java, php, etc. 

The web design field is constantly growing and developing as the years go by. The best way to get started on building knowledge or even keeping up with the newest software and latest techniques is by resourcing to online tutorial websites and begin dissecting one video at a time. When learning the basics or even refreshing, one should always rely on tutorial from a reliable and resourceful websites such as [Lynda](http://www.lynda.com) and [W3Schools](http://w3schools.com) both giving you all the tools to get started.

Although web design tutorials will teach you the basic knowledge remember web developing is a very tedious task and I recommend attending schooling and seminars to expand your knowledge further if planning on pursuing it as a career. In the mean time start watching those tutorials.
