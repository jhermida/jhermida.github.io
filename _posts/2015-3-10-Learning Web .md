Learning web design is a tedious task which consist of lots of reading and practice. Basic web is made up of hypertext markup language embedded resulting in the display of a page. Although, take in to consideration the misplacement of a single character could be the reason behind you page displaying or not.  Commonly one will need basic knowledge in HTML & CSS both to create your common navigational website such as a portfolio or informative site.  In order to create websites with more extensive coding such as an ecommerce site you will have to learn languages such as java, php,jquery etc. 

The web design field is constantly growing and developing as the years go by. The best way to get started on building knowledge or even keeping up with the newest software and latest techniques is by resourcing to online tutorial websites and begin dissecting one video at a time.
