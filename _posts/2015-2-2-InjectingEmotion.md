#Inject Emotion Into The Customer#
Injecting emotion into your customer to attract them to your product is  a very important strategy used in gaining the customers attention and  believing that the product or service is directly intended for them, Which is exactly what every person with a purpose on attracting a clientele for their product, or even a fan base  to their personal blog should try injecting emotion into what ever there proposition is. 

How can I inject some emotion into my consumer you may ask? 
Yes, everyone gains emotion through seeing images, from maybe some background music. Although in my opinion and as stated it the electronic book “Web Copy That Sells” one of the most successful ways of mastering this technique is by speaking, and in web copywriting cases in text. Just like in those infomercials on TV when they are trying to sell you fat burners they start off “HEY YOU!! Are you sick of dieting and still not fitting into last years bathing suite? Tired of eating salad for lunch? “ The consumer quickly thinks “Hey that’s me” . Although you might not want to implement a video in a web design you can easily layout some emotion using quotes as advertising.
