## 1. First impression

Greet your clients with nothing but great attitude, not giving any negative vibes, you always want your client to feel welcome.

## 2. Passionate for your job

Always seem passionate about your job, Its what you do for a living , if you don’t like it try finding something else that suits your needs that may interest you more in order to keep that passion rolling. 

There is nothing worse than to have an unmotivated sales person behind their product even if the customer knows that they are getting good quality showing zero passion and ambition towards what you do will drive away a lot of customers.

## 3. Never say NO!

I find saying no right off the jump really annoys customers, Always say let me see what I could do for you, or offer them another 
solution that is beneficial to both you and them. Always try to keep the word NO out of your vocabulary when dealing with a 
customer.

## 4. Own up to your mistakes 

In case that you have an issue on your hands when the customer is unhappy and there is a doubt in your mind that it could’ve been 
done better or what they are saying sounds logical always give them the upper hand. You don’t want to loose a client on bad terms 
that’s is how negative feedback is started.

## 5. Give returning clients something to hold onto.

Always try and give your regulars some extra love. Make them feel special, lsiten to them get to know them, what they like, their hobbies,
make them feel like a friend or better yet part of your family.

## 6. "Hooked-Up"

Always use your better knowledge when dealing with a client who seems lie them have alot to bring to your plate. If you see your client s always
bringing work thru your door slip them a discount here and their maybe even something on the house, These are the people you want to keep around.

## 7. Always invite them back

Just like you want your customer to feel no negativity nor not welcomed, you dont want them to feel this way on the way out. Even if the 
tenssion was high or mistakes were made, you always want to end on a goof note.
