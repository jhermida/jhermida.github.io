#Why would I pay so much money for a custom website when I could get one for $300 on the Internet?

As a person in the market for a website you have to look at the broader spectrum of what the website is going to do for you in return. A custom website offers you to choose what you want, rather than those $300 websites are just templates which the programmer simply plugs your content into a pre formatted file and return it to you with nearly zero work and zero thought going into it. 

With that said, A custom website is always going to be a better call for any one in the market for a site. Whether you are a lawyer trying to market yourself or a company trying to sell your new watches your best bet is to ditch out a little extra. Templates are embedded with code used over and over again supporting numerous websites around the world. Not only does that affect your searches because of SEO issues it also brings down your rankings overall. 

Another benefit of getting a private web designer to work on your web is that it could always be updated for any new pages, content boxes, logo, etc. as on the pre designed templates you are limited to what you have purchased and any updating usually has to be done by yourself if possible.  What if you want to start showing 4 angles of the watches instead of 2 angles that your were showing previously give your designer a call and they can take care of it 

At the end of the day if you get a designer you wont regret it you will have your personalized web page to your specific needs of your company, it also helps with SEO, and can always be updated easier than your templates could be.
