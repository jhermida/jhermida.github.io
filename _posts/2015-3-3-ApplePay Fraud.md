#Did Apple Not Take Precaution When Releasing#


Fraud is a battle for credit card companies on a day-to-day basis.  [Apple Insider!](http://appleinsider.com/articles/15/03/02/banks-scrambling-to-combat-apple-pay-identity-fraud---report) recent reports that [Apple’s](http://Apple.com) Apple pay had been used in banking fraud. If you remember in the Apple keynote 2014 Apple released their idea of Apple pay. Apple pay was introduced in early 2015 making payments more convenient for Iphone 6 and 6 plus users, using your fingerprint to pay off your balance wherever the service is available. 

Well the day finally came where credit card scammers found a way around it. Apparently banking institutions had been granting access to Apple pay users with simple information such as name and last 4 of social which isn’t hard to come across for these expert thieves. Making the Apple pay granted on the thieves phones will allow them to access bank accounts with out having a card or pin when making a purchase.  

So who is to blame? Apple fortunately has nothing to do with the authorization process meaning that the banking institutions are at fault allowing access to the accounts with such minimal security when accessing such sensitive data.
