#Best designed real estate websites

Many private real estate companies gain most of their success through there personal webpages. But this success does not come with ease. The better your content, design, and use of site are the more successful you will become when managing an online real estate company. Whether you specialize if luxury homes, family homes, apartments etc. all play into perspective when designing. For example one might need a more sophisticated layout when selling a multi million-dollar home to another real estate who would prefer brighter color pallets to help sell their beach side cottages..

Very unique and colorful design layout using html5 and css3 effects to make up the composition. The website minimizes the amount of text and information used do to the structure.

 I hope this post makes it easier for potential real estate companies to know what they are looking for when thinking of a design concept for their website making it easier to tell the designer exactly what they are in the market for.
