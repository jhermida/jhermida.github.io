The analogous color scheme is one of the easiest color schemes to create. By using three colors which are next to each other on 
the traditional 12-spoke color wheel. Although most analogous color schemes have the same chroma level, by adjusting aspects such as tint,and shade we are able to use this color scheme throughout any composition.

#*Complementary*

As pictured above the complimentary color scheme is made up of simply choosing two colors from direct opposing sides of the color wheel. Even though the complementary color scheme is made up of only two colors, as we stated previously by playing with the tones you can create a complementary color palate which are made up of your two starting colors.

#*Split Complementary*

The split complementary is slightly differnt then your standard complementary color schemes. This color scheme consist of three starting colors, as most of the color schemes do consist of more than two except for your standard complementary. To choose this scheme you select two complementary colors as done before, once you have choose those two colors directly across you will use one of those two colors, and choose two more colors which are dirctly next to the opposing color or your choice as picture above.
