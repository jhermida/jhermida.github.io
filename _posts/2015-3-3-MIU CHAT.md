#As you know MIU launched their new student chat.#

Sign up now! There are always fellow classmates no matter the time willing to exchange helpful information on these weeksâ€™ assignments.

MIU now offers their free chat application which you can conveniently download straight through your [Student Portal!](https://mycampus.artinstitutes.edu/portal/)  or available through your application store on your mobile devices as well. This application was created by students for students in order to communicate with fellow classmates spreading knowledge and upcoming activities through instant messaging. With chat rooms created for each major you can easily access information, helpful tips, and even help on projects which your teacher may not have had the chance to respond to as you were working on it.Trying to learn a little more that would benefit you from another major? This would be a great place to exchange information with students and possibly set up some tutoring.

Now That you are thinking about that assignment you were just stuck on, how about you click at the top of your screen and get signed up for the MIU student chat and get it done now.
